# Introduction
This project is based on the code from the Deeplearning training class: [MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Apps with Anthropic](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/mcp-build-rich-context-ai-apps-with-anthropic). 

The goal is to clean up the flow in the code and expand to support MCP servers in the same project.
